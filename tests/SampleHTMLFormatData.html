<h1>Level 1 heading</h1>
<p>
This is a paragraph
</p>
<p>
And this is another one.

Trying out tables here:

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Column Header 1</th>
  <th>Column Header 2</th>
  <th>Column Header 3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>R1C1</td>
  <td>R1C2</td>
  <td>R1C3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>R2C1</td>
  <td>R2C2</td>
  <td>R2C3</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Level 2 heading</h2>
This is a sentence which appears in different fonts and sizes and has things
like <mark>background colours</mark> and <font color="green"> foreground</font> colours all thrown in.

<h3>Level 3 heading</h3>
Here is an example of a bulletted list with formatting within the items:
<ul>
<li>the <b>first</b> item</li>
<li>the <i>second</i> item</li>
<li>the <u>third</u> item</li>
</ul>

<p>
Trying out the abbreviation tag <abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr>.
</p>

<h4>Level 4 heading</h4>
And here is an example of an enumerated list:
<ol>
<li>
it<b>em num</b>ber one for with an email for <a href="mailto:joe.bloggs@abc.com">Joe Bloggs</a>
</li>
<li>
item numero two
</li>
the item after the second item
<li>
a fourth item that links to the <a href="www.bbc.co.uk">BBC</a>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
This is just a short paragraph.

<h5>Level 5 heading</h5>
<p>
Here is an interesting item that should not show in the markdown:
</p>
<img src="img/test_image.jpg" height="200" width="200">

<p>
If you see anything about it, there is a problem.
</p>

<h6>Level 6 heading</h6>
The following block of text is meant to be a blockquote:
<blockquote>
<i>
And now a few sentences about something that just goes on and on and maybe
continues for enough lines to make it a substantive blockquote.  It's still
not as long as it could be.  Here is another bit of text to make it an even
taller and weightier bit of text.  Oh and the overall text is intentionally
odd.
